# Mathematical-Programming
NO, THIS IS NOT LIKE AMPL: It is not even close: It is NOT mathematical modeling related
About (my) Mathematical Programming, the programming resembles APL, with funny symbols. But the theory of it is just Math with a little programming. So there a no side-effects to functions, like functional programming, since values do not change. There are no tuples and arrays, since it is meant to resemble math. And there is absolutely no hardware based items, making it like sympy.
