This document DOES NOT SHOW THE ORDER OF OPERATIONS
Constants:
        ⅈ:
                The imaginary unit, sqrt(-1)
        ⊤:
                True: a.k.a. 1 (it is 1)
        ⊥:
                False: a.k.a. 0 (it is 0)
Prefix Unary Operators:
        +n:
                Identity function, returns n
        -n:
                Negative n
        ~n:
                Not n, 0->1 everything else results in 0
        ↑n:
                The "unpacking" of n, if n is a set with one element, then it is that element, otherwise it is n
        ∁n:
                The set complement of n
        ℑn:
                The imaginary part of n
        ℜn:
                The real part of n
        ℓn:
                The length of the set of n
