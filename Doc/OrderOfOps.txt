Note:
LTR means left to right evaluation
RTL means right to left evaluation
The groups go from Top to bottom, the topmost being evaluated first, the bottom being evaluated last
For operators with an ascii variant, the ascii variant is shown, the unicode variant is parsed the same as ascii
For now, the sets are in the same place as the equivalent other operation, this will be revised
No ordering of literals are given.

N/A: [] ⌊⌋ ⌈⌉ ()          These are the circumfix unary grouping operators. They work like parens, but do something (except actual parens)

RTL:  + - ~ ∋ ∁ ℑ ℜ ω     These are prefix unary operators
RTL: ^
LTR: * / %
LTR: + -  \                  Binary operator + and -
LTR: < ≤ > ≥ ∈ ⊂ ⊃  ⊆   ⊇      Chained, chaining not implemented as of yet
LTR: ≟ ≠  ≡ ≢                Same situation as above
LTR: & ∩
LTR: | ∪
