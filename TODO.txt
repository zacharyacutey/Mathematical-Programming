MUST FIX SUM AND PRODUCT PROBLEMS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i $sum i $mem {1,2}
that for some reason evaluates to 1

a.k.a.

>>> Function(lambda n : n.IsMemberOf(Finite(Number(1),Number(2))).InfiniteSum().val
1

it should be 2, since the sum of the value of that functions is 2, since there are two members, both definitely in SET_OF_ALL

and for my sake, to implement string methods for evaluation!!!

THEN SOMEONE HELP ME WITH THE PARSER!!!!!!
